                  Manuscript Number: SDATA-25-02814\
                  Manuscript Title: A Synthetic Dataset for Time Series Super-Resolution with Deep Learning\
                  Corresponding Author: Professor Ibarra-Fiallo\
                  \
                  Dear Professor Ibarra-Fiallo,\
                  \
                  Your manuscript entitled \"A Synthetic Dataset for Time Series Super-Resolution with Deep Learning\" has now been peer reviewed and given a **revisions** decision type. This means it is of interest to consider but requires some changes before it can be accepted for publication at Scientific Data.\
                  \
                  Based on the recommendation of the handling Editorial Board member (Alireza Foroozani), we invite you to revise and resubmit your manuscript, considering the points raised. Please supply a detailed point-by-point response to all bespoke editor and reviewer requests, describing how you have addressed their concerns, with your revised manuscript.\
                  \
                  **Please note the re-submission deadline is 30 days from now however there is usually no need to tell us if you need more time.** Please see the "Resubmission and deadline" section for further details.\
                  \
                  In addition, please perform a full check to ensure the paper meets our guidelines (https://www.nature.com/sdata/submission-guidelines). We request this after first round peer review to ensure the re-submitted paper is ready for acceptance as soon as the next round(s) of peer review are complete.\
                  \
                  **This means that if your paper is successfully accepted by the reviewers at the next round, it may be sent for publication immediately**, rather than be sent back to you for further changes.\
                  \
                  If all points are present on re-submissions your paper will go straight back for a second review, so we believe it is in your interests to review these guidelines carefully to ensure this proceeds as quickly as possible.\
                  \
                  **KEY FILES TO PROVIDE AT RESUBMISSION**\
                  \
                  Please provide us with\
                  \
                  \* 1 x Article file. This should be:\
                  \
                  - editable (.docx or .tex - please do not supply a pdf, LaTeX users please see the specific instructions further down)\
                  - marked as an \"Article file\" file type on the system\
                  - singular (no other file in the file list should be marked as an \'Article\')\
                  - be clean (free of highlighting or tracked changes)\
                  - in a final state you would be happy to be published without further edits\
                  \
                  \* All Figures. There should be supplied as separate files, not embedded within the manuscript and should not exceed 5 Mb each.\
                  \
                  \* All Tables, as either separate table files, or embedded within the paper, as long as they are machine-readable (do not paste tables as images or upload as pdfs).\
                  \
                  \
                  \* A supplementary information document and/or oversized supplementary tables, if you need them, however please note that if these are relatively small (e.g. 10 extra figures or tables, a few pages of text) we strongly recommend all information is included in a relevant section of the main article file instead.\
                  \
                  \* A \'Response to Comments\' file. Please note this **must contain responses to ALL reviewer AND Editor comments**. This is to ensure we know every request has been dealt with. Your paper may be sent for further revisions if not. This should be submitted as a \'Related Article file\'\
                  \
                  \* A copy of the article with highlighted changes. Please submit this is as a PDF and make sure it is marked as a \'related manuscript file\'. Please do not attempt to supply this as a .docx or .tex as tracking changes may be removed, or poorly rendered, by the pdf conversion process. The file does not need to be editable. Please do not mark this is an \'article file\' to avoid this file being exported for typesetting.\
                  \
                  **All the external data needs to be live and cited at resubmission**.\
                  \
                  **GENERAL**\
                  \
                  Below is a copy of all our guidelines (https://www.nature.com/sdata/submission-guidelines). These are supplied for all manuscripts and may not require changes to your paper. They do not need a response in you 'response to comments' file.\
                  \
                  **ARTICLE FILE**\
                  \
                  \* Please ensure that manuscript titles do not contain any punctuation and only the first word and any proper nouns are capitalised. Do not use mixed caps or special characters.\
                  \
                  \* Please do not use acronyms in titles, unless you feel the term will be well known to a general audience (e.g., DNA and RNA). We strongly discourage authors from including bespoke terms or acronyms in titles as these will likely not be known to users in advance. This is especially discouraged if you have given your dataset a non-scientific name or acronym that users won\'t be aware of. Unless you envisage the word being useful to understand the contents of the data and/or will be used as a search term to help find the paper, do not include it in the title.\
                  \
                  \* Please ensure scientific species names are italicised.\
                  \
                  \* Please remove any footnotes to avoid confusion with cited references, placing the information within the main text. The only superscript numbers in the main text should be pointers to the reference list.\
                  \
                  \* All references should be numbered sequentially throughout the text and should conform to the Nature style. The reference list should be a numbered list arranged in order of first mention in the paper. Examples of proper formatting can be found here: https://www.nature.com/sdata/submission-guidelines#references. Note that DOIs do all the heavy lifting in a reference, so please include them wherever available.\
                  \
                  \* The Abstract should be a single paragraph (about 150-200 words) with no references or URLs (do not cite the data in here) and should serve as a brief, non-technical summary of the topic of your paper. No abstract subheadings should be included. Please use one continuous paragraph.\
                  \
                  \* Section subheadings should not be numbered, (e.g 1. Background, 2. Methods). Remove these if you have used them\
                  \
                  \* Please ensure the order of these sections is correct for your manuscript type (see: https://www.nature.com/sdata/submission-guidelines#sec-1)\
                  \
                  \* In most cases, websites or dynamic web resources (e.g. GitHub links, URLs for software, news articles, etc) should be cited by embedding the URL in the main article text in parentheses at first mention and should not be included in the main reference list. The use of formal references should be limited to items with complete metadata (e.g. a journal or repository name, DOI, identifiers.org-linked accession number). Every resource - whether mentioned in the text or referenced in the list - should provide readers with some means of finding it (e.g. a DOI as a first preference, URL, or other means of finding the item). Naming the object alone is usually insufficient, and please also avoid pointing to general homepages by using as specific a URL as possible.\
                  \
                  \* Unfortunately, our policies do not allow the inclusion of unpublished works within the References section. Therefore, if any references are not yet formally accepted and considered \"in press\", please remove them from the text, or consider citing a pre-publication format with more complete metadata (e.g., a preprint). Every cited item should have some digital or print provenance.\
                  \
                  \* \[Data Descriptors only\] If you have not done so already, please mention which repository the dataset can be found in the \'Data Records\' section, with a corresponding data citation into your main \'References\' section, as per our submission guidelines (https://www.nature.com/sdata/submission-guidelines#data_citations). The first sentence of a Data Record section is typically "The dataset is available at \[name of repository\] \[reference number\], with this section being the primary source of information on the availability and content of the data being described (note this is in place of the "Data Availability\' section present in most 'regular' articles). Please do not include data descriptions in the Code Availability section. Specific instructions on which data to cite, and how, may be included in the comments from the editor (appended at the end of the email).\
                  \
                  \* \[Articles and Comments\] Please also follow the above advice if the paper refers to any externally deposited data but use the "Data Availability" section instead. Items should be described and cited in the same manner, with sufficient detail to allow others to find and use them.\
                  \
                  **AUTHOR LIST, AFFILIATIONS**\
                  \
                  \* All papers need a full author list with details of author names and affiliations. This should be supplied at the start of the manuscript. The journal has no rules on what the order of these names should be.\
                  \
                  \* Author affiliations must be listed in numerical order within the author list, starting with the first author, and will be re-ordered if this is found to be incorrect prior to publication. Please see our guidelines for further guidelines:\
                  \
                  We support two other footnotes below the author list, in addition to affiliations:\
                  \
                  \* MANDATED - you must name at least one corresponding author by indicating an email address for the individual. Please choose someone who will be able to answer any technical questions on the work and has overarching administrative responsibility for the project (they will be the one contacted to pay the APC and sign the license, should the paper be accepted). Ideally their email address should be not expected to change in the short term so contact can be maintained throughout the article\'s lifespan. If multiple people have this role then please indicate multiple corresponding authors. This decision should be made based on practical considerations, rather than as a means of providing credit.\
                  \
                  \* OPTIONAL - if you wish to name multiple \'first\' authors, please use a \"these authors contributed equally\" note against their names.\
                  \
                  \* No other labels are supported (e.g. \"senior author\"). The journal strongly recommends individual contributions are explained in the \'Author Contributions\' statement in the paper, rather than replying on author name positions or informal titles. The CRediT taxonomy is a useful guide to structure this (https://credit.niso.org/) and may be referenced in the Author Contributions statement when used.\
                  \
                  \* **The author list we will publish is the one you have included in your article file**. The author information collected on the submission system is for compliance and administrative purposes and is not made public. This means that if the order, designation (e.g. corresponding author), institution details, or any other small error is different on the submission system but correct in the main article file you do not need to fix this or contact us to tell us\
                  \
                  \* ORCIDs are the only field we publish that is taken solely from the submission system itself and cannot be typeset from information supplied in the article file. ORCIDs included in manuscript files but not on the system cannot be published and we cannot add them to the system on your behalf. Please see the ORCID section below for full details on how to add ORCIDs to your submission.\
                  \
                  \* Authors will need to provide a completed copy of an Author Changes form (https://www.nature.com/documents/Author_List_Changes_Approval_form.docx) with their manuscript files, signed by all present or removed authors, in the case of any change to manuscript authorship made between revisions (if authors are added or removed). Please also update the Author Contributions section, accordingly. These are not required if no change to the author list has been made. Author lists longer than 20 names may restrict the number of signatures to just those added or removed authors and the corresponding authors of the work. This file is also required if the order of authors in the article file has changed in any significant positions - usually the first or corresponding authors - vs the previous version to ensure every author agrees with the change.\
                  \
                  **LONG AUTHOR LISTS AND CONSORTIA**\
                  \
                  \* Consortium (group) authorship should only be used to reduce the length of the main author list. Please do not use these for general advertising purposes or to name the project or institution in the list.\
                  \
                  \* If a consortium is included in the main author list, all members of the consortium are considered bona fide authors, and must be listed together with their affiliations at the end of the Author Contributions statement. The authors and affiliations for the consortium members are an extension of the main author list. Therefore any affiliations already included in the main author list should not be repeated in the Author Contributions statement and the numbering of the affiliations in the consortium should continue in numerical order from those in the main author list - they should not start again from 1. Names should not be duplicated, meaning no names in the main author list should be listed in the consortium and vice versa, as per their role as a purely space saving technique. The consortium itself should be acknowledged with the footnote "A full list of members appears in the Author Contributions." For guidelines on authorship and consortia, please visit: https://www.nature.com/nature-research/editorial-policies/authorship. Another other form of acknowledgement or thanks that does not meet the requirements for authorship should be indicated in the acknowledgements section.\
                  \
                  **LaTeX**\
                  \
                  \* Users wishing to provide their manuscript in LaTeX format should provide the main .TEX file within the manuscript files labelled as an \"Article\" on the system. This should be standalone, meaning it can be compiled to a pdf by itself without having to read any auxiliary files, such as a style sheet or reference files. If you upload your .tex file to our system and it fails to convert, or the generated pdf contains missing elements such as the reference list, please check to ensure no dependencies on other files are listed and all the required information is present in the .tex.\
                  \
                  \* Please note we do not require copies of any auxiliary files on that basis (e.g. the .bib, .cls, or a .zip file, etc) so please do not attempt to upload them (separately, or as a .zip file). Please also do not upload pdf copies of the work that have been compiled outside the system as this may prevent errors in the .tex being spotted and cause delays during typesetting.\
                  \
                  \* As per the guidance above, each submission should only contain one article file and that file should be editable. There is no requirement to supply the .tex for any other documents (e.g. the tracked changes or response to reviewers file). Please use pdfs for these for simplicity as they do not need to be editable.\
                  \
                  **FIGURES AND REGULAR SIZED TABLES**\
                  \
                  \* All figures must be provided as separate files.\
                  \
                  \* The final versions of figure images should be provided in production-quality (300 dpi or above) files as either PDF, EPS, TIFF or JPG formats Please see our guidelines for further information on our requirements (https://www.nature.com/sdata/submission-guidelines#figures).\
                  \
                  \* All Figures should have titles, numbers, and legends in the manuscript text rather than embed large amounts of text in the figure itself.\
                  \
                  \* Figure legends should be included in a separate list at the end of the manuscript under a \"Figure legends\" sub-heading.\
                  \
                  \* Please then add indications in the main text to indicate where you want these to be placed (\"Figure 1 goes here\", or similar)\
                  .\
                  \* Lowercase letters should be used to label panels, where used (Fig. 1a, 1b, etc), however, the entire figure should still be provided as a single file (e.g., \"figure 1.tiff\"), rather than one-file per panel (\"fig 1a.tiff, fig 1b.tiff, etc). This is so the desired arrangement of panels within the figure is clear to our typesetters and represents your choice in how it is displayed - typesetters will not compile or arrange multi-panel figures for you.\
                  \
                  \* **Please do not supply figure files larger than 5 Mb**There are few viable reasons for exceeding this, noting that the image quality will be compressed for HTML publishing and in the published pdf. If the image quality looks ok on a screen at standard zoom it will be acceptable. The same applies for embedding figures within article files, meaning we expect the article file to be \<5 Mb in most circumstances (if not, it is usually due to a larger figure being embedded). As a general editorial consideration, please consider whether the level of detail being encoded in a high-resolution figure image will be visible or useful in a manuscript. If not, the figure might be encoding too much information to be scientifically relevant. Note that if a figure, docx, pdf or other file is not uploading, converting or loading on the submission the most common reason is the file is too large.\
                  \
                  \* Tables should preferably use a simple column/row format, rather than merged cells, to ensure they are typeset correctly. Nested tables and complex arrangements may sometimes be corrupted during the typesetting process. If you table cannot be reasonably represented in Excel please consider re-designing it or breaking it down into smaller units.\
                  \
                  \* Tables should not include shading or highlighting to convey information in cells, as this will be removed upon typesetting. Please use another indicator, such as an additional row/column heading, or explanation in the caption, to indicate what you need to convey.\
                  \
                  \* All Figures and Tables are cited in ascending numerical order in the manuscript text.\
                  \
                  \* Tables should be provided either as separate files in an Excel format, with one Table per file, or embedded directly into the manuscript file if the tables are small. For the former option, embedded tables must be editable within the document, not pasted as images.\
                  \
                  **OVERSIZE TABLES**\
                  \
                  \* Tables that do not fit onto a single A4 page (portrait, typeset) cannot be included in the PDF or HTML version of the main article. Landscape pages can never be accommodated. However, please note that typesetting will reduce the size of tables vs draft, meaning a small overflow onto a second page can usually be accommodated (e.g. 1.5 pages in a draft manuscript will possibly fit into 1 typeset page). If this is not possible these tables will need to be placed in either a supplementary information document or a separate supplementary table file (it is your choice). Very large tables should not be shared within the files at all but shared in a repository. Please see the instructions below for how to manage these in each case.\
                  \
                  **SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION DOCUMENTS**\
                  \
                  \* Scientific Data requests researchers only use supplementary information documents if no other method is suitable. For small amounts of additional text, pages, figures or (small) tables, we strongly encourage authors to just include these in the main manuscript rather than split the content in two, adding extra text, figures, or small tables to the relevant section of the article. Scientific Data is an online only journal and does not have formal page limits and we expect users can scroll or selectively read elements they need - which is a lot easier than having to look in another document. Only if the supplementary information greatly exceeds the length of the original paper (e.g. more than 2x the length of the paper) do we suggest a separate document is used.\
                  \
                  \* Where a supplementary information document cannot possibly be avoided, the content should be provided as a single combined PDF with a table of contents on the first page. All supplementary figures and small/medium supplementary tables should be included within this, with each figure and table given a label (Figure S1, Table S1, etc) and caption. Please note this document will not be typeset by the journal and will be shared unchanged from the version provided in your final submission. Please do NOT share individual supplementary figures or small/medium table files to avoid these being shared as isolated images attached to the paper - everything should be included within a document. Please do not use an Appendix in the main paper - this is a separate file. Oversized tables placed within these documents can be placed on landscape pages, or run over to a small number of pages, unlike in the main text.\
                  \
                  \* The document should be titled \"Supplementary Information\" and file type listed as \"Supplementary Information\" on the system. There should be no \"supplementary information\" sub-heading within the article file, or other captions/list to refer to them (just mention the item within paragraph when required).\
                  \
                  **SUPPLEMENTARY TABLES**\
                  \
                  \* A supplementary table is a table too large to fit in the main text that you would prefer to share on the platform as a separate .xlsx file rather than in the SI document. Because of this, there is no document in which to place a caption, so these should be self-contained with any guidance notes, etc, placed within the file itself. It is your choice whether oversized tables are placed in an SI document (see above), as separate supplementary tables, or both. Please use the same numbering scheme for both when mentioning these in the main text (Table S1, S2 etc, in order of appearance). Where tables are shared with both methods it can be helpful to readers to explain. E.g. "Table S1 (see Supplementary Information document), Table S2 (see supplementary xlsx file).\
                  \
                  \* Supplementary xlsx files should be titled "Supplementary Table SX" (where X is the relevant number) and marked as "Supplementary Information" as the file type on the system.\
                  \
                  \* Excessively large tables that include significant amounts of data (e.g. 50+ rows or more, and/or a large number of columns) should be deposited with a repository (https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/repositories). Either as a new deposition if none other exists, add to any existing datasets, citing these via a reference number and describing these in the Data Record section (for Data Descriptors) or Data Availability section (for other article types) as with any repository file. The word "Supplementary" should NOT be used to describe files that are external to the manuscript files (e.g. those within a repository), so please rename these to something else if the convention is used and ensure any descriptions in the main text are updated (in the Data Record section).\
                  \
                  \* All Supplementary information (text section, figure or table) must be mentioned at least once in the article text.\
                  \
                  **EXTERNALLY HOSTED DATA AND CODE**\
                  \
                  \* Please do not use the word \"supplementary\" in your article file to refer to files hosted in external repositories. The word should just be used to refer to the files above (information and large tables hosted with the paper). \"The dataset\" or \"the code\" is fine, with the appropriate URL/reference number. This can cause issues in typesetting where copy editors (incorrectly) assume these files are associate with the manuscript and cannot find them.\
                  \
                  \* As part of our code sharing policies, we ask authors to mention any custom code used in the work in the Code Availability section of the manuscript and provide details on how to find it. Details of third party software used in the work should be provided in the Methods section when the tool is mentioned with the Code Availability section limited to custom items. In all cases URLs or other relevant metadata should be included to allow readers to find the information (rather just naming the code/tool). More details regarding our Code Availability policies can be found here: https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/editorial-and-publishing-policies/#code-avail. The purpose of this policy is to provide readers with the full means to reproduce the work as required.\
                  \
                  \* The final accession numbers or DOIs for any deposited datasets must be incorporated into the relevant data citations in the reference list. We cannot publish papers with incomplete data citation metadata. Please see any specific instructions from the Editor if required (below).\
                  \
                  \* All data and code needs to be live at the point of re-submission so that the paper is ready to accept and process for publication if the next round of peer review is successful. Our team will typically lookup the relevant accession number or resolve the dataset doi (via doi.org/DOI, looking for a live page) to check the data can be practically downloaded and papers will be returned to you to revise before ongoing review if this is not complete. Please note that no editorial checks are made after acceptance so there is no suitable point to check and remind authors to release data and code closer to publication (hence why we ask now).\
                  \
                  \
                  **OTHER POLICIES AND ETHICS**\
                  \
                  \* If any figures feature any recognizable human study participants, a statement confirming that informed consent to publish their likeness was obtained must be added to the corresponding Figure Legend, or in the manuscript. More information on our digital ethics policies can be found here: https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/editorial-and-publishing-policies/#digital-image. If not, all real human depictions need to be suitably anonymised.\
                  \
                  \* We require all authors to declare any competing financial or non-financial interests that relate to their work. Please provide a competing interests\' statement on behalf of all authors, even if just to state a lack of conflict. This statement should be placed alongside the Acknowledgements.

                  Reviewer #1 (Remarks to the Authors (required)):\
                  \
                  Scope\
                  1. Does this paper present a description of a series of data files available at a repository, without associated results or analyses being presented?\
                  Yes. The manuscript includes some analyses, but they are limited to basic assessments of data quality and do not present any scientific results or hypothesis-driven interpretations.\
                  \
                  2. For primary or theoretical data, are most of the data newly described and not published elsewhere? For secondary/derived/compiled data, do they present new annotations or compilation vs their primary sources?\
                  Yes. The data are theoretical and not published elsewhere. The manuscript mentions that \"CoSiBD has been used in research presented at the International Conference on Signal Processing and Machine Learning\" but does not provide an explicit reference.\
                  \
                  Data Quality\
                  3. Was the dataset produced in a rigorous and methodologically sound manner?\
                  No. The authors show no evidence that the proposed synthetic signal model generates time series that resemble at least some real-world time series from any of the referenced domains. The noise model is undocumented, and provided code shows a single-tone sinusoid noise model that is not justified (temana.py lines 101 and following). Most concerningly, the dataset fails to define or discuss sampling frequency, does not apply anti-aliasing filters before subsampling, and omits units on time axes, despite being explicitly intended for \"super-resolution\" tasks. Aliasing artifacts are visible in some of the \"low-resolution\" signals in cases where the \"resolution\" is reduced by a factor of 20 and the \"high-resolution\" signals include higher frequencies (files SignalAVFV_Super_Sample250_5000.txt vs SignalAVFV_Sub_Sample250_5000.txt).\
                  \
                  4. Is the technical quality of the dataset supported convincingly?\
                  No. Although the authors include a section titled \"Technical Validation\", the analyses presented are superficial, qualitative, and in some cases conceptually flawed. For example, they attempt to assess frequency content stability across \"sampling resolutions\" but fail to apply anti-aliasing filters prior to downsampling. Similarly, their claims about the impact of noise on signal spectra are based on a possible mischaracterizations of the artificially added noise, which is a deterministic sinusoid, not Gaussian or broadband.\
                  With respect to the metadata, given that the signals consist of multiple segments with changing frequency content, it would be desirable to have annotations of the signals themselves. The dataset includes predefined validation sets, but their selection criteria are undocumented. Predefining validation sets imposes arbitrary usage assumptions and limits flexibility.\
                  Overall, the dataset is poorly justified, inconsistently validated, and unlikely to be reusable by other researchers. The \"Technical Validation\" section, in particular, is filled with vague statements and plausible-sounding technicisms that lack clear definitions or analytical substance. In particular, the final sentences of most paragraphs in this section make vague assertions about the data\'s properties or suitability without offering quantitative support, reproducible criteria, or references to established signal processing standards.\
                  \
                  5. Is the depth, coverage, size, and/or completeness of these data sufficient for others to use them?\
                  No. There is no indication that the dataset captures the diversity, complexity, or statistical properties of real-world signals from any of the domains the manuscript mentions.\
                  \
                  Completeness of the Description\
                  6. Are the methods and any data processing steps described in sufficient detail to allow others to reproduce these steps?\
                  The signal generation process is technically reproducible, but not transparently or reliably so without manual code inspection. In particular, the signal generation process is described at a high level, and the accompanying code allows for reproduction in principle. However, critical details---such as the sampling frequency, time units, and precise characteristics of the noise---are missing from the manuscript. While comments are present in the code, users are required to interpret implementation choices themselves, as key modeling decisions are undocumented or implicit.\
                  \
                  7. Are the descriptions of the data files sufficient for users to make use of them?\
                  Yes, to a basic extent. The file names and accompanying table provide enough information for users to access and interpret the core structure of the dataset. However, the absence of detailed metadata or per-signal descriptions may limit more advanced or domain-specific uses. Also, the authors use the terms \"samples\", \"points\" and \"signals\" without defining them. From Table 1, the reader may infer that the authors consider \"samples\" and \"signals\" to be synonyms, though that contradicts the usual nomenclature in fields such as signal processing.\
                  \
                  Integrity of the Data Files and Repository Record\
                  8. Have you confirmed that the data files deposited by the authors are complete and match the descriptions in the Data Descriptor?\
                  Yes. I have inspected the deposited data files and confirmed that their naming, structure, and contents match the descriptions provided in the manuscript, Table 1.\
                  \
                  9. Have these data files been deposited in the most appropriate available data repository?\
                  Yes. The data are deposited in Zenodo under a CC BY 4.0 license. The code is available on GitHub under an MIT license.\
                  \
                  10. Has all the code been shared?\
                  Yes. The full code for signal generation has been shared, including all functions and modules used. While some parts could benefit from clearer documentation and cleanup, the code appears sufficient to reproduce the dataset.\
                  \
                  \
                  Reviewer #2 (Remarks to the Authors (required)):\
                  \
                  This manuscript presents the CoSiBD dataset, a synthetic collection of time-series data for super-resolution tasks, along with the Temana library for signal generation. The idea of offering a reproducible environment for testing signal reconstruction models is useful, but the work would benefit from significant improvement in clarity, scope, and validation.\
                  \
                  1. Scope and Contribution\
                  The current dataset design focuses mainly on synthetic sinusoidal signals with random frequency and amplitude variations. While technically correct, this approach is limited in its capacity to represent realistic time-series phenomena. The paper would be strengthened by motivating why such signals are relevant to real-world applications and by comparing the proposed dataset with existing benchmarks.\
                  \
                  2. Experimental Results\
                  The manuscript lists evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, PSNR, and SSIM but does not present any numerical results or baseline comparisons. Without quantitative or visual evaluation, it is not possible to assess the usefulness of the dataset for super-resolution studies.\
                  \
                  3. Figures and Presentation\
                  Figure 1 contains too much explanatory text and reads like an infographic. It would be clearer if simplified, with key information moved into the caption or text. Figures 2 and 3 have no axis labels or units, making it impossible to interpret the plots. All figures should include labeled axes and consistent legends.\
                  \
                  4. Reproducibility and Code\
                  Although providing source code is appreciated, the included examples for reading or plotting the data are overly basic and not suitable for a research article. More importantly, the random number generation in the code does not use fixed seeds, which prevents reproducibility. Please mention whether seeds were set or explain why variability was allowed.\
                  \
                  5. Writing and Typographical Issues\
                  The manuscript contains typos (e,g,, frecuency bands in Fig.1, step 7) and inconsistencies. Several paragraphs repeat similar explanations of the dataset's purpose and composition. Careful proofreading and editing will improve readability and professionalism.\
                  \
                  6. Overall Assessment\
                  The dataset and accompanying library could be useful as supporting material for a more extensive study, for example, a methodological paper on time-series reconstruction. However, as a standalone contribution, it does not provide enough novelty or experimental depth. The work has potential if presented as part of a larger project with more comprehensive validation and clearer writing.\
                  \
                  In its current form, I suggest substantial revision before resubmission. The concept is sound but would benefit from stronger motivation, clearer results, and improved presentation.\
                  \
                  \
                  \
                  Reviewer #3 (Remarks to the Authors (required)):\
                  \
                  Great to see the authors propose a complex dataset that captures variability, stability, and realism to match real-world scenarios.\
                  \
                  I have one major weakness on the evaluation and usefulness of this dataset\
                  The study lacks a demonstrative impact of the data. Given the motivation of the data is for use with deep learning methods. Experiments where CNNs, RNNs and LSTMs are trained with simulated data and validated on real-world data would have been more convincing.\
                  \
                  Would be great to see side-by-side comparison of how the objectives of variability, stability, and realism, maintaining reproducibility and flexibility compares to those measured from real-world signals.\
