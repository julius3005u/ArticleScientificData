INSTRUCTIONS / PROJECT CONTEXT (ArticleScientificData)
Date: 2026-01-16

Purpose
- Prepare a Scientific Data (Nature Portfolio) Data Descriptor manuscript for the CoSiBD dataset.
- Ensure all editor/reviewer feedback is incorporated DIRECTLY into the manuscript text (no separate rebuttal required for submission).
- Provide a durable, auditable mapping from reviewer requirements to the final manuscript text.

Hard Constraints (DO NOT VIOLATE)
1) No dataset/raw-data inspection for reviewer-response work
   - When answering reviewers or justifying claims, do NOT open/analyze dataset files (e.g., SignalBuilderC/data/*, Zenodo files, generated signals). Use ONLY:
     - TeX manuscripts
     - Reviewer/editor requirement list
     - BibTeX/references
     - Figures already included in the manuscript
2) Super-Resolution (SR) pairing narrative must be consistent
   - Low-resolution (LR) signals are defined strictly as uniform decimation / uniform subsampling of the high-resolution (HR) sequence.
   - Do NOT describe prefiltered/anti-aliasing variants as dataset objectives.
   - The only allowed filtering-related sentence is exactly:
     “Reconstructing low-pass filtered signals is not an objective of CoSiBD.”
3) Keep Scientific Data “Data Descriptor” tone
   - Validation is descriptive/illustrative, not hypothesis-driven.
4) Do NOT delete unrelated project content
   - Creating new files/folders is fine; avoid removing other work.

Authoritative Files (Sources of Truth)
- Reviewer/editor checklist: ReviewrsRequirementsAndAnswers.txt
- Clean manuscript (authoritative final text): main_englishv09_final.tex
- Tracked-changes manuscript: main_englishv09.tex
- Bibliography: referencias.bib

Key Submission/Packaging Deliverables
- Release package folder: ArticleFinal/
  - Contains the TeX manuscripts (clean + tracked), PDFs, bib, class/style files, and figures with preserved paths.
  - Build/compile was previously verified inside that folder.

Licensing Statements (Must remain consistent)
- Code/scripts: MIT License (GitHub repo referenced in manuscript)
- Dataset record (Zenodo): CC BY 4.0

Evidence-Backed Reviewer Response Artifact
- Notebook: AnswersToReviewers.ipynb
  - English, item-by-item answers for Editor items (E1–E2) and reviewer items (R1-1..R1-16, R2-1..R2-8, R3-1..R3-2).
  - Each item includes:
    - Manuscript location pointers (sections/labels, figures/tables)
    - Verbatim TeX excerpts as evidence
    - A concise response explaining what changed / where
  - Must not claim dataset inspection.

Build / Compile Notes (for LaTeX)
- Class/style present in repo: wlscirep.cls, naturemag-doi.bst, jabbrv.sty, jabbrv-*.ldf
- Typical build uses BibTeX; see COMPILE_INSTRUCTIONS.md if present.

Terminology & Conventions to Keep Stable
- “signal” = one full 1D time-series sequence
- “samples” = discrete values in that sequence (e.g., N=5000 samples per signal)
- Frequency/Hz reporting uses an illustrative time-scaling convention described in Methods; Hz axes depend on assumed sampling rate.

What to Do When Continuing Work
- For ANY reviewer answer or manuscript claim, first locate evidence in main_englishv09_final.tex.
- If tracked changes visibility is needed, corroborate in main_englishv09.tex.
- If you cannot support a claim with manuscript text, do NOT invent; instead, revise manuscript text or mark as “not addressed.”

Files You Should NOT Treat as Evidence for Reviewer Responses
- Any dataset/data outputs, generated files, or raw signal arrays.
- Backups (backup_tex/*) should not override the authoritative final manuscript unless explicitly requested.


Quick Checklist (read in 30 seconds)
- Evidence source: main_englishv09_final.tex is authoritative.
- Do NOT open/analyze dataset/raw data files for reviewer answers.
- LR definition: uniform decimation / uniform subsampling only.
- Keep this exact sentence (and avoid other low-pass objectives):
  “Reconstructing low-pass filtered signals is not an objective of CoSiBD.”
- Do not claim anti-aliasing/prefiltering as a dataset objective.
- Maintain Scientific Data tone: validation is descriptive/illustrative.
- Licensing must remain consistent: code MIT; dataset record CC BY 4.0.
- Do not delete unrelated project content.
