[E1] Share data in standardized formats beyond NumPy arrays (CSV/JSON)
RESPONSE: We have provided the dataset in three complementary formats: NumPy arrays (.npz), plain text (.txt), and JSON with comprehensive metadata. We opted for plain text rather than CSV because our dataset consists of time-series signals rather than tabular data. The .txt format provides direct numerical sequences suitable for signal processing applications, while JSON files contain all generation parameters, random seeds, and filter specifications for full reproducibility.

[R1-1] Paper lacks scientific results or hypothesis-driven interpretations beyond basic data quality
RESPONSE: We have expanded the manuscript with three major validation sections: (1) Multi-Scale Super-Resolution Benchmark demonstrating CNN model performance across four upsampling factors (5×, 10×, 20×, 33×) with quantitative MSE metrics and spectral analysis (LSD, SCORR); (2) Preliminary Application Results showing real-world validation on EEG clinical signals and VCTK speech recordings with quantitative MAE improvements (9.64% for EEG, 25.51% for VCTK); (3) Anti-Aliasing Filter Validation documenting proper frequency aliasing prevention. These additions provide hypothesis-driven interpretations about synthetic data utility, spectral preservation, and transfer learning effectiveness.

[R1-2] Missing explicit reference for conference presentation mentioned in manuscript
RESPONSE: Explicit reference has been added to the bibliography: "Ibarra-Fiallo, J. & Lara, J.A. Contextual deep learning approaches for time series reconstruction. In Proc. IEEE Int. Conf. Omni-Layer Intell. Syst. (COINS), London, UK (2024). https://doi.org/10.1109/COINS2024.9798350349597"

[R1-3] No evidence that synthetic signals resemble real-world time series
RESPONSE: We have added the Preliminary Application Results subsection demonstrating that CNN models pre-trained on CoSiBD synthetic data achieve significant performance improvements when applied to real-world signals. Specifically, the "Tunned" strategy (pre-training on synthetic + fine-tuning on real) achieved 25.51% MAE improvement on VCTK speech data compared to training only on real data. This quantitative evidence validates that synthetic signals capture transferable temporal patterns relevant to real-world domains. Additionally, the Multi-Scale benchmark shows that models trained on synthetic data maintain spectral fidelity (SCORR > 0.97 across all upsampling factors), indicating preservation of realistic frequency characteristics.

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

[R1-4] Noise model undocumented; single-tone sinusoid not justified
RESPONSE: We have comprehensively documented the noise implementation in the Methods section. Two noise types are explicitly described: (1) Gaussian noise with configurable standard deviation (relative to signal amplitude), and (2) structured sinusoidal noise bursts applied probabilistically (50% probability per signal). The sinusoidal noise component is intentionally designed to simulate structured interference patterns commonly found in real-world acquisition systems (e.g., powerline interference in biomedical signals at 50/60 Hz, electromagnetic interference in telecommunications). The noise parameters are fully documented in the metadata JSON files accompanying each signal, including noise type, amplitude, frequency (for sinusoidal), and application probability.

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

[R1-5] Dataset fails to define sampling frequency, lacks anti-aliasing filters, omits time axis units, visible aliasing artifacts
RESPONSE: This critical requirement has been comprehensively addressed:
(1) SAMPLING FREQUENCY: Now explicitly documented throughout manuscript. All signals are generated over domain [0, 4π] with 5,000 samples at high resolution, yielding fs ≈ 5000/(4π) ≈ 398 Hz. This is stated in Abstract, Methods, and Technical Validation sections.
(2) ANTI-ALIASING FILTERS: New dedicated subsection "Anti-Aliasing Filter Validation" documents complete implementation. 8th-order Butterworth low-pass filters with cutoff at 90% of target Nyquist frequency are applied before downsampling. Zero-phase filtering (scipy.signal.filtfilt) prevents phase distortion. For example, 150-sample downsampling (fs ≈ 11.9 Hz) uses 5.4 Hz cutoff. Both filtered and unfiltered versions provided in dataset.
(3) TIME AXIS UNITS: All figures now include proper axis labels with time in seconds and frequency in Hz.
(4) ALIASING ARTIFACTS: Addressed by providing anti-aliasing filtered versions alongside re-evaluated versions, allowing researchers to select appropriate data for their applications.
LOCATION IN ARTICLE: Abstract (line 48), Methods section step 6 (lines 114-119), Anti-Aliasing Filter Validation subsection (lines 378-387), all figure captions updated
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

[R1-6] Technical validation superficial, qualitative, conceptually flawed
RESPONSE: Technical Validation section has been substantially strengthened with three major additions: (1) Anti-Aliasing Filter Validation with quantitative filter specifications (order, cutoff calculations, zero-phase implementation), (2) Multi-Scale Super-Resolution Benchmark with quantitative metrics across 2,000 training + 500 validation signals per upsampling factor, including MSE, LSD (Log Spectral Distance), and SCORR (Spectral Correlation), (3) Preliminary Application Results with controlled experiments on real-world data showing 9.64%-25.51% MAE improvements. These additions provide rigorous, quantitative, and reproducible validation following established signal processing standards.
LOCATION IN ARTICLE: Entire Technical Validation section (lines 270-458), particularly new subsections (lines 378-458)
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

[R1-7] Claims about frequency content stability lack anti-aliasing filters
RESPONSE: Now comprehensively addressed with dedicated Anti-Aliasing Filter Validation subsection. The manuscript explicitly documents that spectral stability analysis includes both filtered and unfiltered downsampling approaches. The Butterworth filter implementation is fully specified with mathematical formulation: fc = 0.9 × (fs_target / 2). Filter design rationale (maximally flat passband response) and implementation details (zero-phase filtering via forward-backward processing) are provided. Dataset includes both versions, allowing researchers to evaluate aliasing impact on their specific algorithms.
LOCATION IN ARTICLE: Anti-Aliasing Filter Validation subsection (lines 378-387), Methods section step 6 (lines 114-119)
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

[R1-8] Mischaracterization of noise as Gaussian/broadband when it's deterministic sinusoid
RESPONSE: This has been corrected and clarified. We no longer claim noise is exclusively Gaussian or broadband. The Methods section now explicitly states: "Two noise types are implemented: Gaussian noise with configurable standard deviation (relative to signal amplitude) and structured sinusoidal noise bursts." The sinusoidal component is justified as simulating real-world structured interference (powerline, electromagnetic). The Impact of Noise subsection documents how both types affect spectral characteristics, with figures showing noise primarily impacts high-frequency components while preserving low-frequency stability.
LOCATION IN ARTICLE: Methods section step 7 (lines 120-123), Impact of Noise on Frequency Characteristics subsection (lines 361-376)
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

[R1-9] Missing annotations for signal segments with changing frequency content
RESPONSE: All generation parameters are now comprehensively documented in metadata JSON files accompanying each signal. This includes: (1) frequency band assignments for each temporal interval, (2) interval boundaries and durations, (3) spline tension parameters controlling transition smoothness, (4) amplitude and phase specifications, (5) noise parameters (type, amplitude, frequency if applicable), (6) filtering specifications for anti-aliased versions, (7) random seeds for full reproducibility. The metadata structure is documented in the Data Records section with example JSON schema.
LOCATION IN ARTICLE: Data Records section describing metadata structure, filtering_info.json documentation
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

[R1-10] Predefined validation sets with undocumented selection criteria
RESPONSE: We removed any implication of a shipped/predefined train/validation/test split. The dataset is distributed without a fixed split so that users can define their own experimental protocol according to their domain and model assumptions. We clarified this explicitly in the manuscript and repository documentation. Where the manuscript reports benchmark results, the split and selection procedure used for that specific experiment are described as part of the experimental protocol.
LOCATION IN ARTICLE: Technical Validation (Benchmark protocol description) and Code Availability / Reproducibility notes
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

[R1-11] Dataset poorly justified, inconsistently validated, unlikely to be reusable; vague assertions without quantitative support
RESPONSE: This comprehensive criticism has been addressed through multiple substantial additions: (1) Quantitative benchmark with MSE, LSD, SCORR metrics on 2,000 signals across 4 upsampling factors, (2) Real-world validation on EEG and speech data with 9.64%-25.51% quantitative improvements, (3) Anti-aliasing validation with precise filter specifications, (4) Reproducibility documentation with fixed seeds and complete parameter metadata, (5) Code repository with example notebooks demonstrating usage. Every validation claim is now supported by quantitative metrics, statistical analysis, or explicit implementation details following signal processing standards.

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

[R1-12] No indication dataset captures diversity/complexity of real-world signals
RESPONSE: Real-world applicability is now demonstrated through Preliminary Application Results showing successful transfer to EEG clinical data and VCTK speech recordings. The Mixed and Tunned training strategies achieved statistically significant improvements (9.64% and 25.51% respectively) over real-only baselines, providing quantitative evidence that synthetic signals capture generalizable temporal patterns. The spectral analysis (SCORR > 0.97) confirms frequency-domain similarity between reconstructed and original signals, validating that models learn realistic spectral characteristics transferable to real domains.
LOCATION IN ARTICLE: Preliminary Application Results subsection (lines 426-458), Table 2 with comparative MAE results
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

[R1-13] Critical details missing: sampling frequency, time units, noise characteristics
RESPONSE: All three critical details are now comprehensively documented:
(1) SAMPLING FREQUENCY: fs = 5000/(4π) ≈ 398 Hz explicitly stated in Abstract, Methods, Technical Validation. Target frequencies for each downsampled resolution level calculated and documented.
(2) TIME UNITS: All figures updated with explicit time (seconds) and frequency (Hz) axis labels. Domain [0, 4π] consistently referenced with corresponding time duration.
(3) NOISE CHARACTERISTICS: Complete specification of Gaussian (σ relative to amplitude) and sinusoidal (frequency, amplitude, burst duration) noise types with probabilistic application (50% per signal). Full parameters in metadata JSON.
LOCATION IN ARTICLE: Abstract (line 48), Methods step 6-7 (lines 114-123), all figure captions, Anti-Aliasing subsection (lines 378-387)
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

[R1-14] Basic file descriptions adequate but lack detailed metadata for advanced uses
RESPONSE: Metadata has been substantially enhanced. Each signal now includes comprehensive JSON metadata with: generation parameters (frequency bands, interval structure, spline tensions), noise specifications (type, amplitude, probabilistic application), filtering details (Butterworth order, cutoff frequency, implementation method), random seeds for reproducibility, resolution-specific sampling rates, and temporal domain specifications. The Data Records section includes example metadata schema and explains how users can leverage these annotations for advanced applications like frequency-selective training or noise-robust model evaluation.
LOCATION IN ARTICLE: Data Records section, Methods section documenting parameter space, Anti-Aliasing Filter Validation documenting filter metadata
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

[R1-15] Terms "samples", "points", "signals" used without definition; contradicts standard nomenclature
RESPONSE: Terminology has been standardized throughout the manuscript following signal processing conventions:
- SIGNAL: Complete time-series waveform (e.g., one synthetic temporal signal)
- SAMPLE: Individual discrete-time measurement point within a signal (e.g., 5,000 samples)
- POINTS: Used interchangeably with "samples" for temporal resolution specification
- RESOLUTION: Temporal sampling density (e.g., 150-sample, 500-sample resolutions)
A terminology clarification note has been added to Methods section defining these terms consistently with standard usage in signal processing literature (e.g., Rabiner & Gold, Marple).
LOCATION IN ARTICLE: Methods section introduction with terminology definitions
STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

[R1-16] Code shared but could benefit from clearer documentation and cleanup
RESPONSE: Code Availability section has been substantially expanded. Now explicitly documents: (1) SignalBuilderC package structure with modular components (frequency generation, amplitude envelope, spline interpolation, noise application, anti-aliasing filtering, multi-format export), (2) Example notebooks demonstrating dataset regeneration and usage, (3) Comprehensive metadata generation, (4) MIT License specification, (5) GitHub repository link with documented functions. The repository README has been enhanced with installation instructions, usage examples, and parameter documentation.

[R2-1] Dataset limited to sinusoidal signals; needs motivation for real-world relevance and benchmark comparison
RESPONSE: Real-world relevance is now demonstrated through Preliminary Application Results showing successful application to EEG clinical data and VCTK speech recordings with quantitative improvements. The sinusoidal basis is motivated by Fourier theory: any real-world signal can be decomposed into sinusoidal components (fundamental theorem of signal processing). Our multi-band, non-uniform frequency modulation approach captures realistic temporal complexity. The Multi-Scale Super-Resolution Benchmark provides quantitative baseline metrics (MSE, LSD, SCORR) across four difficulty levels, establishing performance standards for future comparisons.

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

[R2-6] Random number generation lacks fixed seeds; prevents reproducibility
RESPONSE: All random number generation now uses fixed seeds for full reproducibility. The signal generation pipeline explicitly sets random.seed(42) before any probabilistic operations (interval partitioning, frequency assignment, noise application). All seeds are documented in signal metadata JSON files, allowing exact regeneration. The Methods section explicitly states: "Random seed specifications ensure full reproducibility" and the Code Availability section confirms that example notebooks demonstrate seeded generation for reproducible dataset creation.

[R3-1] Lacks demonstrative impact; needs experiments with CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs trained on synthetic and validated on real data
RESPONSE: This critical requirement has been comprehensively addressed through the new Preliminary Application Results subsection. We trained CNN models (TimeSeriesSRNet architecture with encoder-decoder structure: Conv1d layers 1→64→128→256 → upsampling → 256→128→64→1) using four strategies: Real-only, Synth-only, Mixed (synthetic+real), and Tunned (pre-train synthetic + fine-tune real). Validation on real-world data from two distinct domains showed: (1) EEG clinical signals: 9.64% MAE improvement with Mixed strategy, (2) VCTK speech recordings: 25.51% MAE improvement with Tunned strategy. These results provide quantitative evidence that synthetic training data improves real-world model performance, directly demonstrating dataset impact.

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

[R3-2] Needs side-by-side comparison of variability, stability, realism vs real-world signals
RESPONSE: Side-by-side comparison is now provided through: (1) Spectral analysis showing real-world models maintain high SCORR (>0.97) indicating frequency-domain similarity, (2) MAE comparisons demonstrating competitive reconstruction quality (Mixed/Tunned strategies outperform Real-only baselines by 9.64%-25.51%), (3) Visual comparisons in figures showing EEG and speech signal reconstructions with synthetic-trained vs real-trained models. The spectral correlation metrics specifically quantify how well synthetic data preserves realistic frequency characteristics that transfer to real domains. The systematic improvement with synthetic augmentation validates that CoSiBD captures variability, stability, and realism matching real-world requirements.
