\begin{highlights}
    \item Synthetic data can effectively support 1D signal super-resolution when combined with real data or used for pretraining.
    \item Pretraining on synthetic datasets enables representation transfer across domains, providing a viable solution when real high-resolution signals are scarce.
    \item The synthetic data does not resemble real data to effectively aid super-resolution tasks. Being highly variable and non-stationary appears sufficient.
