\subsection*{Related synthetic time-series resources}

Publicly available synthetic resources for temporal signals exist, but they are typically designed for tasks other than time-series super-resolution (SR), or they target a specific domain. In wireless communications, the RadioML family provides large collections of synthetic complex I/Q sequences with varying SNR and channel impairments, mainly to benchmark automatic modulation classification rather than paired SR reconstruction \cite{oshea2016grcon,deepsig_datasets,deepsig_radioml2018}. In biomedical signal processing, physiological simulators such as ECGSYN (ECG) and SEREEGA (EEG) enable controlled generation with tunable morphology, sampling settings, and noise, supporting method development when real data access is constrained \cite{mcsharry2003ecg,ecgsyn_physionet,krol2018sereega}. In power systems, LoadGAN provides multi-resolution generation of load time series across sampling rates and time horizons (from sub-second to long-term scales), but it is not distributed as a standardized paired SR benchmark \cite{pinceti2021loadgan}. Domain-specific paired low-/high-resolution training data can also be produced via physical forward modeling, e.g., low- and high-resolution 1D seismic traces for learning-based resolution enhancement \cite{yuan2024seismic}.

Table~\ref{tab:related_synthetic_datasets} summarizes these representative resources and highlights a practical gap: while many tools provide synthetic signals, they usually do not jointly offer (i) multi-factor paired LR--HR signals for time-series SR, (ii) both direct re-evaluation and anti-aliasing-filtered downsampling pipelines for constructing low-resolution observations, and (iii) per-signal metadata (including random seeds) enabling exact sample-level reproducibility. CoSiBD is designed to address this gap by providing multi-resolution paired signals, optional anti-aliased observations, explicit nuisance modeling (noise and structured interference), and comprehensive metadata for reproducible SR benchmarking across multiple difficulty levels.

\footnotetext[1]{``Configurable'' indicates that LR--HR pairs can be constructed by running the simulator at different sampling settings and/or applying controlled downsampling, but a standardized paired SR benchmark (multi-factor LR versions aligned to a fixed HR target) is not typically distributed as part of the resource.}
