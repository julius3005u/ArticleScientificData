CoSiBD is a **synthetic benchmark** designed to support *controlled, reproducible* evaluation of time-series super-resolution methods under systematically varied difficulty factors (piecewise non-stationarity, intermittent high-frequency activity, amplitude envelopes, baseline drift, and noise). The goal is not to claim that any specific domain is faithfully reproduced, but to provide a **transparent, parameterized generator** and paired LR–HR signals with rich metadata so that researchers can benchmark SR models in a reproducible setting and tailor generation settings to domain-specific needs.\n",

    "We agree that unit conventions must be explicit. CoSiBD signals are released as **discrete sequences** \\(x[n]\\) defined over a **reference domain** \\(\\tau \\in [0,4\\pi]\\). Interpreting \\(\\tau\\) as physical time (seconds) requires selecting a duration \\(T\\) for the reference interval, which then implies a sampling rate \\(f_s = N/T\\). To avoid ambiguity, the manuscript now (i) explains the reference-domain design, (ii) provides an **illustrative convention** \\(T = 4\\pi \\text{ s}\\) for reporting example Hz values, and (iii) makes clear that changing \\(T\\) rescales Hz values while the discrete sequences remain unchanged.\n",

    "We thank the reviewer for this important signal-processing point. CoSiBD’s paired LR–HR observations are produced via **uniform decimation without pre-filtering** by design. This choice is now explicitly stated and justified as part of the benchmark’s intent: SR models in practice often face LR observations that may contain measurement artifacts and are not always produced by ideal anti-aliasing pipelines. Providing LR signals via decimation creates a reproducible, transparent degradation process that includes challenging conditions SR methods must handle.\n",

    "To address conceptual clarity, the manuscript now (i) states the decimation procedure explicitly, (ii) avoids implying that LR spectra should match HR spectra in an “anti-aliased” sense, and (iii) frames validation plots as descriptive documentation of behavior under the reported generation settings, not as proofs of optimal sampling practice.\n",
